title: "Pagination & Sorting"
description: "Many Propify GET endpoints return an array of results. To make it easier to work with these results, we provide standard pagination and sorting options to be used in the query string."

# Pagination
There are two optional parameters that can be used to control pagination of results: `offset` and `limit`. Each can be used independently, or together.

## Meta Object
The `meta` object is returned at the root with every paginated response payload. It contains information about the query that was performed.

```json Example meta object
{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0, // default is 0
    "limit": 100, // default is 100
    "orderBy": [], // default is empty array
    "hasMore": Boolean // (no default)
  },
  results: [] // the data you requested
}
```

## Limit
The `limit` parameter is used to limit the number of results returned. For example, if you wanted to limit the results to 10, you would use `limit=10` as a query string parameter in the URL. If you do not define a limit, the default is 100.

```json Example use of limit
// GET https://api.getpropify.com/v1/<model_name>?limit=10

{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10,
    "orderBy": [],
    "hasMore": true // or false
  },
  "results": [] // 10 results
}
```

## Offset
The `offset` parameter is used to skip a number of results. For example, if you wanted to skip the first 10 results, you would use `offset=10` as a query string parameter in the URL. If you do not define an offset, the default is 0.

The below example would skip the first 10 results, and return the next 100 results.

```json Example use of offset
// GET https://api.getpropify.com/v1/<model_name>?offset=10

{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 10,
    "limit": 100,
    "orderBy": [],
    "hasMore": true // or false
  },
  "results": [] // 100 results
}
```

## hasMore
The `hasMore` parameter is used to indicate if there are more results available. If there are more results available, the value will be `true`. If there are no more results available, the value will be `false`. This can be used to determine if you should make another request to get more results, or optionally increase the `limit` value.

# Sorting
Propify provides a sorting mechanism that can be used to sort results by one or more fields. The `orderBy` parameter is used to define the sort order. The `orderBy` parameter is an array of objects, where each object contains a `field` and `direction` property.

## order-by Query String Parameter
The `order-by` parameter is used to define the sort order. It is a combination of `field_name` and `direction` separted by a colon. For example, if you wanted to sort by the `id` field in ascending order, you would use `order-by=id:asc` as a query string parameter in the URL. If you wanted to sort by the `id` field in descending order, you would use `order-by=id:desc` as a query string parameter in the URL.

If you wanted to sort by multiple fields, you would provide a comma separated list of fields and directions. For example, if you wanted to sort by the `id` field in ascending order, and then by the `name` field in descending order, you would use `order-by=id:asc,name:desc` as a query string parameter in the URL.

```json Example use of order-by
// GET https://api.getpropify.com/v1/<model_name>?order-by=id:asc,name:desc

{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 100,
    "orderBy": [
      {
        "field": "id",
        "direction": "asc"
      },
      {
        "field": "name",
        "direction": "desc"
      }
    ],
    "hasMore": true // or false
  },
  "results": []
}
```
