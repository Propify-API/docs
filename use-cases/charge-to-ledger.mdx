## Workflow
Insert charge into resident payment ledger.

## Relevant Business Types
Resident benefits & amenities, rent payments, security deposit alternatives, services that charge resident a fee.

## Description
Your business may find it valuable to add charges directly to a resident's payment ledger. This allows residents to pay for your service from within the property management software while you can collect fees from the property management company. 

## Steps

**Proptech generates a charge with associated metadata**
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.getpropify.com/v1/transactions \
  --header 'propify-api-key: <propify-api-key>' \
  --header 'propify-api-secret: <propify-api-secret>' \
  --data '{
  "integration_id": "<integration_id>"
  # ... other required fields
}'
```

**That charge is pushed into the resident payment ledger, and will be collected by the property manager via the payment portal**
