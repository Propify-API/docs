title: "Filtering Results"
description: "You can filter results by adding query parameters to your request. For example, you can filter by a specific property or unit, or by a specific lease ID."

## Overview
The Propify API provides optional query string parameters to provide the ability to filter results on requests that return arrays of objects. One example of filtering is finding all residents associated with a lease (by the Propify lease ID). This can be done by filtering on the `lease_id` property.

```json Example
// GET /v1/residents?lease_id=123456
```

Note: When filtering using external IDs (e.g. `x_*`), you will be required to supply the Propify integration ID (`integration_id`) and the external property ID (`x_property_id`) as part of your query string. This is to ensure that you are only getting records associated with your intended result set â€” in an effort to account for property management systems using auto-incrementing integers as their IDs.
