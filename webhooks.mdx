Many of our customers use webhooks to get updates on things lease status changes, new leads, and more. We offer webhook events for new and changed data for all of our data models, job status and more.

## Why use webhooks?

Webhooks are a way to integrate with Propify so you know about changes to your data in real-time. Instead of polling the API for changes, you can register a webhook and we'll send you a notification when something changes. You can subscribe to changes on a per data model basis, so you are only notified when the data you care about changes.

## How do webhooks work?

You set up a URL on your system that we will send a POST request to when something changes. We will send you a JSON payload with the data that changed. You can then use that data to update your system.

```javascript Example route (in YOUR system) to receive webhook
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook/leases', async (req, res) => {
    const data = req.body;

    // Perform business logic
    for (const lease of data.results) {
        const { status: prevStatus } = lease.previous;
        const { status } = lease.new;
        if (prevStatus === 'pending' && status === 'approved') {
            const { email } = lease.tenant;
            // Send an email to the tenant
            await app.sendEmail(email, 'Your lease has been approved');
        }
    };

    res.send(200);
});
```

Then, in Propify, you can register your webhook URL and subscribe to the events you care about (data-diff on the lease model, in the example above).

Now each time Propify identifies a change in the lease model for a particular lease, you will be notified via a POST request to your webhook URL.

The above example is intended to be a simple example of how webhooks work. In practice, you will want to use a more robust system to receive and process webhooks. For example, you will want to use a queueing system to ensure that you don't lose any webhook events if your system is down.
