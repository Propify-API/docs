## Overview
When making requests to the Propify API, you will need to pass proper authentication headers so that you can identify yourself as an authorized user.

```bash
'propify-api-key': '<api-key>'
'propify-api-secret': '<api-secret>'
```

## Additional Headers
There is an additional header that is required for all requests to the Propify API. That header and its value can be found in the access section of the Propify dashboard once you log in.
